# Cheero Documentation 

Cheero is an open-source developer healthcare vs code extension that basically helps the developer keep their focus for long periods of time through some thorough entertainment in between such as some funny memes to refresh their mood. It has currently about 5 features, Daily Motivational Quotes, 2 to 5 Memes, Random Programming facts, interesting blog suggestions, especially for students, and reminders for 10-minute  
naps, small walks, and water drinking. 
## Features (Overall Product after complete development)
There will be many features that will be very useful for building good habits for healthy development and our overall goal is to reduce the stress and improve the health-related habits of developers that many developers simply ignore (I was one of them though). 

Right now this will be the basic documentation of my project but afterwards I'll improve it as the development takes place.
